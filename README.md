CSI Project V2  

CSI Project V2 is an interactive Java Swing application used to simulate a crime scene investigation workflow.  
Users can load suspects, load evidence, compare findings, and ultimately convict (or wrongly convict!) a suspect based on evidence matches.

This version includes a full analysis workspace with:
- Suspect list panel  
- Evidence board panel  
- Automated matching engine  
- Random guilty suspect each run  
- Conviction system  
- Professional dashboard UI  

Features

Analyze Case
A full analysis workspace including:

Suspect Panel  
Selectable table of suspects.

Evidence Board  
Selectable comparison panel with all evidence.

Matching System  
Each evidence item can match a suspect based on:
- Type weighting  
- Relevance strength  
- Random guilty assignment  
- Logic tuned so only ONE suspect can realistically reach the required match threshold

Result Output  
- Shows match count  
- Shows confidence percentage  
- Allows conviction only when match count ≥ 3

Conviction System  
If the user convicts:
- Correct suspect > “Guilty!” message  
- Incorrect suspect > “Wrong Suspect!” message
